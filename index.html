        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I'm a student at Code the Dream, where I'm learning the fundamentals of programming with the goal of gaining new skills and breaking into the tech field. My experience as a dog and house sitter has helped me develop strong responsibilty, problem-solving skills, and attention to detail-qualities I'm excited to apply as I dive deeper into tech. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, drawing, painting, and reading. I'm looking forward to continuing my learning journey and connecting with others in the tech community. </p>
